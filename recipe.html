        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn on your grill, let it preheat for some time.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While pre-heating, take your time to prepare your patties and toppings. Tear your lettuce into leaves that will fit in your bun. Finely dice it if you want to. Slice your tomato into four round slices for your four burgers.
    </p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Unfreeze your ground beef and form them into circles. That will be your patty to go on the grill. Skip this step if you have pre-made patties, just unfreeze them.
            
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Your grill should be heated at this point. Place your patties onto the grill and flip them every so often until evenly cooked to your liking.
            
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 5 (optional):</strong> Place a slice of cheese on top of your patty to let it melt.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Serve by transferring your done patty to a burger bun. Add your toppings and condiments, and eat away. </p>

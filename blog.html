        <h6>Posted on July 20, 2021</h6>
        <p>Have I ever seen myself learn coding on my own? Not really. However, I made it one of my efforts to do so. I joined a coding class around the start of July, and, with all honesty, I could admit that programming your own things is kind of fun. I began this class by learning the basics of JavaScript. Well, this variation of JavaScript named Processing.js. It was relatively fun, messing around with shapes and images to create small interactive animations. I spent around two weeks learning this language, before moving on to HTML and CSS, two languages that essentially make up the web. This was probably an annoying one, but learning how the infrastructure of the internet works, all being powered by HTML and CSS, was quite a fact to behold. I essentially can create a webpage on my own, which is what I am doing with this blog. Anyways, I still have a long way to go.

        <p>I would like to welcome you to this random page, where I will post the journeys I take in my life. I mean, that's what blogs are for, right? Anyways, this site was all created by me, applying this wonderful new programming (well, two seperate, but very intertwined with each other) language. We call it HTML (and CSS). Eventually, we will get into more insight of what I do here, so all you need to know about my blog: I will post my efforts and stuff here if I ever felt like it. Thanks for visiting!</p>
